Known Bugs:

    When logged in:
    - If you delete the account you're logged in as, the app crashes 
    because it kind find the session ID. A temporary fix for this is to restart the application
    and clear your browser cache.
    
    When adding a new car:
    - If you don't insert every field when adding a new car, the code used to insert
    an image breaks and you won't be able to load cars. You can fix by temporarily removing
    the image code on the cars index page and then refreshing and deleting the record causing
    problems
